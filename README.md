Data and code for Tragopogon genomics
Here you will find the R scripts and data for the data generated and analyzed for the manuscript titled: 

Homeolog loss and silencing in synthetic allotetraploid Tragopogon species (Asteraceae) mirror alterations in natural populations. (in review) Frontiers in Genetics. Authors: Ingrid Jordon-Thaden, Lyderson Facio Viccini, Brandon Jordon-Thaden, Jennifer Tate, Srikar Chamala, Grant Godden, Wei Wu, Cheng-Ting Eddy Yeh, Alvis Hu, Patrick S. Schnable, W. Brad Barbazuk, Douglas E. Soltis and Pamela S. Soltis. 

The raw data generated by the Mass-Array Sequenom is too large to be included. Please refer to the Frontiers in Genetics website to find that data (Supplmentary Materials 7a and 7b). 

Also, included is the installation widget for doing more complicated statistics in Excel, XRealStats-Mac.xlam from the following developer: Charles Zaiontz at https://real-statistics.com/
